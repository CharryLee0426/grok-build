# Grok Build command inventory and desktop routing

Audited against this checkout on 2026-09-23. This is a source inventory and
integration contract. The running harness remains authoritative for feature,
tool, account, project-trust, plugin, and skill availability.

## Sources of truth

- [Shell slash catalog and resolver](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/session/slash_commands.rs): built-ins, gates, aliases, skill collision handling, saved workflows, and `commands/list` types.
- [Pager command registration](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/src/slash/commands/mod.rs): every registered terminal slash action; individual modules supply syntax and aliases.
- [Pager slash guide](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/04-slash-commands.md): user-facing terminal semantics.
- [CLI command tree](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/src/app/cli.rs): process-level commands, distinct from conversation slash commands.
- [ACP extension dispatch](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/mvp_agent/acp_agent.rs), [extension result envelope](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/session/result.rs), and [session notifications](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/notification.rs).

## Desktop routing contract

The composer should merge native actions with the live harness command catalog.
Typing `/` opens a searchable list with descriptions, argument hints, and source
badges. Selecting a command with arguments inserts it into the composer; execution
is a separate submit action. Native management commands open their corresponding
panels. Only recognized harness commands and explicitly authored ordinary prompts
go to `session/prompt`; pager-only commands must not silently become model prompts.

Fetch `_x.ai/commands/list` with `{ "cwd": "/project" }` before session creation
and `{ "sessionId": "id" }` afterward. The response is **raw**
`{ "commands": [...], "tools": [...] }`, unlike many wrapped extension responses.
Consume `session/update` with `sessionUpdate: "available_commands_update"` as a
full catalog replacement, including commands removed by a model or skill change.
That update's `_meta.tools` is the current tool set. Each command supplies
`name`, `description`, optional `input.hint`, and optional `_meta` provenance:
`scope`, `path`, `bareName`, `pluginName`, or `workflowSource`.

Rust extension method names omit the leading underscore. Their JSON-RPC wire
names use `_x.ai/...`; standard ACP methods such as `session/set_mode` do not.
Most management methods return JSON-RPC `result` containing another
`{ "result": <payload>, "error": <optional string or object> }` envelope. Check
both error layers. Do not manufacture success on empty or unsupported responses.

Native action names take precedence over conflicting unqualified names; keep
qualified skill entries usable. Shell built-ins reserve their names and the
pager's names, so a skill named `compact` is advertised as e.g. `local:compact`.
Use the advertised name verbatim when invoking a skill or workflow.

## Shell commands available through `session/prompt`

The catalog contains the following potential built-ins. Entries with a gate are
only available when advertised by the current harness. Aliases are accepted by
the resolver but are not separate advertised entries.

| Command and aliases | Arguments / effect | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/compact` | Optional instructions about context to preserve | Always |
| `/always-approve`, `/yolo` | `on` or `off`; enables or disables permission bypass | Always |
| `/flush` | Flush conversation memory to disk | Memory enabled |
| `/dream` | Consolidate stored memory | Memory enabled |
| `/memory`, `/mem` | Browse memory; desktop may open a native memory panel | Memory configured |
| `/context` | No-op in the shell; the desktop shows context natively from `_x.ai/session/info` | Always |
| `/hooks-trust` | Trust current project for hook execution | Hooks |
| `/hooks-list` | List loaded hooks | Hooks |
| `/hooks-add` | Hook file or directory path | Hooks |
| `/hooks-remove` | Previously configured hook path | Hooks |
| `/hooks-untrust` | Remove current project trust | Hooks |
| `/plugins`, `/plugin` | `list`, `reload`, `trust`, `add <path>`, `remove <path>` | Plugins |
| `/plugins install` | `<source> [--trust]` | Plugins |
| `/plugins uninstall` | `<name> [--confirm]` | Plugins |
| `/plugins update` | Optional plugin name; omission updates all | Plugins |
| `/reload-plugins` | Alias action for `/plugins reload` | Plugins |
| `/session-info`, `/status`, `/info` | Model, turns, context, session details | Always |
| `/feedback` | Feedback text | Feedback |
| `/deep-research` | Research query | Workflow launches |
| `/workflow` | `<name> [input]`; or `runs`, `pause <run>`, `resume <run>`, `stop <run>`, `save <run>` | Workflow launch or retained-run management |
| `/goal` | `<objective> [--budget <positive tokens>]`; or `status`, `pause`, `resume`, `clear` | Goal |
| `/loop` | `[interval] <prompt>`; transformed into scheduler instructions | Scheduler |
| `/<advertised-skill>` | Skill arguments; supports qualified scopes/plugins | Enabled, user-invocable skill |
| `/<advertised-workflow>` | Workflow launch arguments | Workflow launches |

The plugin resolver recognizes install/uninstall/update even though its advertised
argument hint only lists the first five operations. A budget flag is parsed only
as a valid positive integer at the end of a goal objective. Bare `/goal` is status.
Named workflows accept `--agent-budget N` and `--effort LEVEL`; the shell validates
launch input. A bare workflow resume cannot increase an exhausted agent budget.

## Pager command inventory and desktop behavior

This table enumerates every registered pager command, including hidden and debug
entries and the two screen-mode commands. Every command has a desktop
implementation: native windows and sheets for panels and pickers, native toggles
for preferences, and the same harness methods, files, and messages the terminal
uses. **Harness** means the command is forwarded as a prompt because the shell
implements it. Desktop preferences that the terminal also reads (`[ui]` keys,
`[models]` defaults, `[agent]`, `[subagents.toggle]`, `[hints]`) are written to
`$GROK_HOME/config.toml` one key at a time, keeping the rest of the file intact.

While a turn is streaming, native panels and toggles still open at once;
prompts, skills, and harness commands wait in the queue (see `/queue`); and the
few commands that need an idle task (`/plan`, `/imagine`, `/imagine-video`,
`/flush`, `/dream`, `/rewind`, `/fork`, `/delete`, and `/model` or `/effort`
with an argument) keep your draft and ask you to wait or stop the turn.

The registry contains 75 pager commands.

| Command (source) | Aliases | Syntax | Desktop behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`/always-approve`](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/src/slash/commands/always_approve.rs) | `/yolo` (shell) | `/always-approve [on\|off]` | Native: composer permission menu; sends `_x.ai/yolo_mode_changed` to every task, saves `[ui].permission_mode`, answers waiting permission requests once enabled |

## Management ACP contracts

The tables use actual wire names and JSON key spelling. Optional fields are marked
with `?`; placeholders are types rather than literal JSON values.

### MCP servers and tools

Source: [extensions/mcp.rs](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/mcp.rs).

| Method | Request | Payload / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_x.ai/mcp/list` | `{sessionId?: string, cache?: bool}` | `servers`, `sessionMcpResolved`; refresh with `cache:false` after enrollment |
| `_x.ai/mcp/toggle` | `{session_id, server_name, enabled}` | Toggle a server; harness enforces policy |
| `_x.ai/mcp/toggle_tool` | `{session_id, server_name, tool_name, enabled}` | Toggle an individual tool |
| `_x.ai/mcp/auth_status` | `{session_id}` | Servers with snake_case `server_name` and status |
| `_x.ai/mcp/auth_trigger` | `{session_id, server_name}` | Start auth; may return setup requirements or error |
| `_x.ai/mcp/setup` | `{sessionId, serverName, values: {key: value}}` | Complete a server's declared setup schema |
| `_x.ai/mcp/upsert` | `{session_id, server_name, ...config}` | Add/update user config, then reload; config is flattened harness `McpServerConfig` |
| `_x.ai/mcp/delete` | `{session_id, server_name}` | Remove a locally configured server; managed entries cannot be deleted here |
| `_x.ai/mcp/call` | `{sessionId?, server, serverUrl?, tool, arguments}` | Explicit MCP tool execution |
| `_x.ai/mcp/read_resource` | `{sessionId?, server, uri}` | Resource content |

List entries have `name`, optional `displayName`, `source` (`local`/`managed`),
transport `type` (`stdio`/`http`/`managedGateway`), and optional session state:
`enabled`, `status`, `tools`, `authRequired`, `setupRequired`, `blockedReason`.
The session tool list contains `name`, optional description, and `enabled`.
Treat `_x.ai/mcp/tools_changed`, `_x.ai/mcp/servers_updated`, and initialization
notifications as triggers to refresh the relevant task's catalog. Toggle calls
deliberately use snake_case; setup and list deliberately use camelCase.

### Skills, plugins, hooks, and saved workflows

Sources: [skills](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/skills.rs),
[skill schema](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-tools/src/implementations/skills/types.rs),
[plugins](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/plugins.rs),
[hooks](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/hooks.rs),
[marketplace](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/marketplace.rs).

| Method | Request | Payload / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_x.ai/skills/list` | `{cwd}` | `skills` |
| `_x.ai/skills/config` | `{cwd?}` | Configured paths, ignore paths, total, skills, message |
| `_x.ai/skills/add` | `{cwd?, path}` | Persist discovery path, reload, return skills |
| `_x.ai/skills/remove` | `{cwd?, path}` | Remove configured path; does not delete source files |
| `_x.ai/skills/reset` | `{cwd?}` | Restore default skills configuration |
| `_x.ai/skills/toggle` | `{cwd?, name, enabled}` | Update disabled-name list and return skills |
| `_x.ai/skills/refresh-baseline` | `{}` | Refresh live session skill baselines after changes |
| `_x.ai/workflows/list` | `{sessionId}` | Saved workflow definitions in this session |
| `_x.ai/plugins/reload` | `{}` | Rebuild registry and fan out to live sessions |

`SkillInfo` fields are **snake_case**, including `display_name`, `plugin_name`,
`argument_hint`, and `user_invocable`; `name`, `description`, `path`, `scope`,
and `enabled` are always useful. Skills can be `local`, `repo`, `user`, `server`,
`bundled`, or `plugin` scoped. The toggle endpoint currently matches bare `name`
across scopes; it is not an independently scoped per-plugin toggle. The slash
catalog, rather than a reconstructed name from the list, is invocation authority.

### Live subagents, background tasks, and agent definitions

Sources: [task handlers](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/task.rs),
[child messaging](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/subagent_message.rs),
[bundle catalog](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/bundle.rs).

| Method | Request | Payload / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_x.ai/subagent/list_running` | `{sessionId}` | `subagents` with IDs, description, type, timing and progress |
| `_x.ai/subagent/get` | `{subagentId, block?: false, timeoutMs?}` | `snapshot` including status and finished output/error |
| `_x.ai/subagent/cancel` | `{subagentId}` | Cancellation outcome; may already be finished |
| `_x.ai/subagent/message` | `{sessionId, agentAddress, queue?: false, content:[{type:"text",text}]}` | Feature-gated literal human steering; opaque address from spawn notification |
| `_x.ai/task/list` | `{sessionId}` | Background task snapshots |
| `_x.ai/task/kill` | `{sessionId, taskId, source?: "clientUi"}` | Typed stop outcome |
| `_x.ai/scheduler/delete` | `{sessionId, taskId}` | Delete a scheduled task |
| `_x.ai/bundle/status` | `{}` | `hasCache`, `version`, persona/role/agent/skill names and details |
| `_x.ai/bundle/entry/get` | `{kind: "agent"/"persona"/"role", name}` | Source content for an entry; kind is singular |
| `_x.ai/bundle/sync` | `{force?: true}` | Refresh cache for future construction; does not replace the running agent |

There is no public `subagent/spawn` extension in the audited dispatch. Model tools
and workflow launches create subagents. A desktop **Delegate** action can submit
an explicit delegation prompt and render actual spawn events; it must not claim
that a child exists until the harness reports it. Agent definitions (`/agents`)
are separate from live children and the multi-session dashboard.

`subagent_spawned`, `subagent_progress`, and `subagent_finished` arrive through
`_x.ai/session/update` with `{sessionId, update:{sessionUpdate,...}}`. Their fields
are mostly snake_case, while list/get snapshots are camelCase. Route child session
events using the spawn parent/child mapping. Preserve completed children when
refreshing a list that contains only running children.

### Plan, goal, and other native actions

[rewind actor implementation](../../crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/session/acp_session_impl/rewind.rs).

- Enter plan mode with `session/set_mode {sessionId, modeId:"plan"}`. Await its
  acknowledgment before sending a `/plan <description>` description as a normal
  prompt. Use the advertised non-plan mode to leave. `plan` is not a config-option
  ID. The saved plan preview is the session artifact `plan.md`; ACP plan-progress
  entries alone are not the full plan document. Preserve reverse permission
  requests for `exit_plan_mode` plan approval.
- Change the model or thinking level through advertised `session/set_config_option`
  IDs `model` and `reasoning_effort` (or the existing model setter). Only offer
  supported values; await acknowledgment.
- Goal controls send the exact recognized `/goal ...` prompt. There is no separate
  goal RPC. Render `goal_updated` fields such as `objective`, `status`, `phase`,
  `token_budget`, `tokens_used`, `elapsed_ms`, and `pause_message`. Recognize active,
  complete, cleared, budget-limited, blocked, and multiple paused states. User pause
  and stop behavior belong to the harness; do not infer success from button clicks.
- `_x.ai/btw {sessionId, question}` returns `result.answer` independently of the
  main turn. It can run while the main turn is active; it is not a normal queued
  message. Additional optional `content` supports ACP text and image blocks.
- `_x.ai/recap {sessionId,auto:false}` acknowledges with wrapped `{ok:true}`;
  `{ok:true,disabled:true}` means the feature is disabled. The result arrives via
  `session_recap {summary,auto:false}` or `session_recap_unavailable`. The desktop
  binds these asynchronous results to the requested task and ignores automatic
  recaps when displaying a manually opened panel.
- `_x.ai/rewind/points {sessionId}` returns raw `{rewind_points:[...]}` with
  `prompt_index`, `created_at`, `num_file_snapshots`, `has_file_changes`, and
  `prompt_preview`. `_x.ai/rewind/execute` takes `{sessionId,targetPromptIndex,mode,
  force}`, where `mode` is `conversation_only`, `files_only`, or `all`. Its raw
  response uses `target_prompt_index`, `clean_files`, `conflicts`, `reverted_files`,
  `prompt_text`, `success`, and optional `error`.
  **`force:false` is always a pure preview and returns `success:false` even when
  there are no conflicts. `force:true` performs the restore.** The desktop first
  previews, requires explicit confirmation, then re-previews immediately before
  committing; conflicts or a changed file list require a fresh review. Conversation
  restores reload authoritative history and place the original prompt in the
  composer. The desktop does not offer an external-conflict override.
- `_x.ai/session/state {sessionId,cwd}` returns persisted metadata, including
  `summary.grok_home` and `summary.info.cwd`. The desktop uses those paths to read
  the local saved `plan.md`, including `.cwd` sidecars for long hashed workspace
  directories. It limits preview reads to 1 MiB. This RPC's `plan` column is a
  separate JSON state file, not the Markdown plan.
- `_x.ai/session/usage {sessionId}` returns raw `{usage}`. Token fields are
  camelCase; `costUsdTicks` uses 10 billion ticks per USD. A missing cost or
  `costIsPartial`/`usageIsIncomplete` flag must not be presented as zero cost.
  These in-memory totals reset with a new runtime process. CLI `grok usage` reads
  persisted totals.

## Process-level CLI inventory

These commands configure or launch Grok itself. They are not slash commands and
should not be inserted into `session/prompt`. Native account, project, extensions,
and task controls can cover applicable operations; process maintenance and
terminal transport commands remain available through **Open in Terminal**.
